# The Services Provided by the Link Layer
	
	-Almost all link-layer protocols encapsulate each network-layer datagram within a link-layer frame before transmission over the link
	-medium access control (MAC) (For point-to-point links that have a single sender at one end of the link and a single receiver at the other end of the link).
	-MAC protocol is simple (or nonexistent)

#how frame created--->

	
		1.On the sending side, the controller takes a datagram that has been created and stored in host memory

		2.the higher layers of the protocol stack, encapsulates the datagram in a link-layer frame (filling in the frame’s various fields).

		3.then transmits the frame into the communication link, following the link-access protocol.

		4.On the receiving side, a controller receives the entire frame, and extracts the network-layer datagram

		5.If the link layer performs error detection, then it is the sending controller that sets the error-detection bits in the frame header and it is the receiving controller that performs error detection.

#Error detecting--->
	
		1.Single bit error
		2.internet checksuming 
		3.CRC

#Multiple Access Links and Protocols--->

	
		1.point-to-point link
		2.broadcast link


		#MAC(multiple access channel) protocols:


					1.channel partitioning:

						• TDMA: time division multiple access
						• FDMA: frequency division multiple access

					2.random access:

						• slotted ALOHA

								• prob that given node has success in a slot = p(1-p)^N-1
								• prob that any node has a success = Np(1-p)^N-1
								• max efficiency: find p* that maximizes Np(1-p)^N-1
								• for many nodes, take limit of Np*(1-p*) N-1 as N goes to infinity, gives :max efficiency = 1/e = .37


						• Pure ALOHA

								• efficiency: 18%
								• unslotted Aloha: simpler, no synchronization




						• CSMA

								• if channel sensed idle: transmit entire frame
								• if channel sensed busy: defer transmission
								• human analogy: don’t interrupt others!


						• CSMA/CD

								• collisions detected within short time
								• colliding transmissions aborted, reducing channel wastage
								• collision detection easy in wired, difficult with wireless
								• human analogy: the polite conversationalist
								• better performance than ALOHA: and simple, cheap, decentralized !

						• CSMA/CA

#Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specifications (DOCSIS)--->


			1.DOCSIS uses FDM to divide the downstream (CMTS to modem)
			2.upstream (modem to CMTS) network segments into multiple frequency channels.


#LAN and switches--->

		1.link-layer switches do not have link-layer addresses associated with their interfaces that connect to hosts and routers
		2.link layer address is variously called a LAN address, a physical address, or a MAC address
		3.ARP resolves an IP address to a MAC address.
		4.ARP resolves IP addresses only for hosts and router interfaces on the same subnet
		5.Each host and router has an ARP table in its memory
		6.ARP is above the link layer.


		#SWITCHES --->

				1.Filtering is the switch function
				2.if there is no entry for the destination address, the switch broadcasts the frame.
